Later, in January 2022, I transitioned to the Registration team, which gave me the opportunity to learn Vue.js and develop a registration management system. Several deployments were carried out during conferences in Vienna and Paris, strengthening my experience in production rollouts and managing technical solutions in real-world conditions."
